Zine Themes
===========

Zine_ is an open source weblog engine written in Python.  

This repository holds my port of the famous `Kubrick theme`_ by 
Michael Heilemann.

The port is released under the same terms as the original work: GPL_.

More information on theme development for Zine can be found in the 
`Zine Wiki`_.


Status
------

The port is still work in progress.


Customization
-------------

The Kubrick theme provides a hook to allow customizazion without altering the
code directly, for example changing the header image. I will soon add an 
example to the repository to show how this can be done.
